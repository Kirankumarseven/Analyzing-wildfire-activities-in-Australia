Analyzing wildfire activities in Australia

## Project Overview
* This project aims to analyze the historical wildfire data in Australia to identify patterns, trends, and key insights. By exploring data related to wildfires across different regions and time periods, the project provides a deeper understanding of the frequency, severity, and impacts of wildfires in Australia. The findings can be used to inform policies, improve response strategies, and raise awareness about wildfire prevention and preparedness.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains historical data on wildfires in Australia. It includes information such as:

* Year: The year the wildfire occurred.
* Location: The region or state in Australia where the wildfire took place.
* Fire Size: The area affected by the wildfire (measured in hectares).
* Cause of Fire: The reason for the wildfire (natural causes, human activities, etc.).
* Fire Impact: The extent of the damage, including destruction of property and lives.
* The dataset is sourced from publicly available records and covers multiple decades of wildfire events.

## Tools and Technologies
* Python: For data analysis and processing.
* Pandas: To load, clean, and manipulate the dataset.
* Matplotlib/Seaborn: For data visualization.
* Plotly: For interactive visualizations and deeper exploration of wildfire data.
* Folium: For creating interactive maps to visualize the geographical distribution of wildfires.
* Jupyter Notebook: To document and share analysis results.
